ConversationBufferMemory is a memory module in LangChain that keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, and uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. It can be used in a chain by setting the memory parameter to ConversationBufferMemory when creating a ConversationChain object. The memory can return multiple pieces of information (for example, the most recent N messages and a summary of all previous messages) as either a string or a list of messages.
