{"query": "Tell me about ConversationBufferMemory in langchain, and walk me through how to use it.", "answer": "ConversationBufferMemory is a memory module in LangChain that keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, and uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. It can be used in a chain by setting the memory parameter to ConversationBufferMemory when creating a ConversationChain object. The memory can return multiple pieces of information (for example, the most recent N messages and a summary of all previous messages) as either a string or a list of messages.", "_timestamp": 1682472839.760285, "_runtime": 10.827059984207153, "_step": 0, "_wandb": {"runtime": 10}}
