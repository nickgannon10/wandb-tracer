{"columns": ["query", "answer"], "data": [["Tell me about ConversationBufferMemory in langchain, and walk me through how to use it.", "ConversationBufferMemory is a memory module in LangChain that keeps a buffer of recent interactions in memory, and uses token length rather than number of interactions to determine when to flush interactions. To use it, first import the ConversationBufferMemory class from langchain.memory. Then, create an instance of the class, passing in the language model and the maximum token limit. To save context, use the save_context() method, passing in the input and output. To load the memory variables, use the load_memory_variables() method. Finally, to use it in a chain, create a ConversationChain instance, passing in the language model, the memory instance, and setting verbose to True."]]}
